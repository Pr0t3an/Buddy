# Buddy
Decided to clean up a tool I have been using for while (may be helpful for others)

Essentially rather than saving commands (no passwords pls) in assortment of notes, copy pasting them to somewhere modifying then executing...use buddy to store the commands adding <@variable@> in the modifiable areas as needed, search, provide variables and its copied to clipboard. 

- Added basic Add/Delete switches (but I find it quicker opening the sqllite file directly in dbbrowser
- Provided a sample DB file that can be downloaded on first launch (id recommend deleting the entries and starting afresh)
- /config/buddy will be downloaded / is expected in the root of application path - though have added some checks that you can symlink run the binary from symlink ok
